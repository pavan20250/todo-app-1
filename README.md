# To-Do App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and integrated with **Appwrite** as the backend service for handling user authentication, database management, and more.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you're ready for it.

## Appwrite Integration

### Setting Up Appwrite

Appwrite has been integrated as the backend for this project to handle user authentication, database operations, and more.

1. **Authentication**: Appwrite's authentication service is used to manage user signups, logins, and email verifications. The app allows users to create accounts, verify emails, and log in securely using Appwrite's easy-to-use API.
2. **Database**: The app uses Appwrite's database service to manage and store application data, such as user details, articles, or any other necessary entities.
3. **Appwrite Client Configuration**: In the project, the Appwrite client has been configured in the `appwrite config.ts` file. This includes connecting to the Appwrite server using the project ID and endpoint URL.

### Connection Setup

To connect your frontend to Appwrite, follow these steps:

1. Install the Appwrite SDK in your project:
   ```bash
   npm install appwrite
2. Create a configuration file appwrite config.ts to set up the Appwrite client:
   ```bash
   import { Client, Account, Databases } from 'appwrite';
   const client = new Client();
   client.setEndpoint('https://[YOUR_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT]/v1').setProject('[YOUR_PROJECT_ID]');

   const account = new Account(client);
   const database = new Databases(client);

3. For database interactions, the Databases object is used to interact with Appwrite's collections and documents:
   ```bash
   const fetchDocuments = async () => {
   try {
    const documents = await database.listDocuments('[YOUR_COLLECTION_ID]');
    console.log('Documents:', documents);
   } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching documents:', error);
   }
   };
